      Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means,
      with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip. Travel can also include relatively short stays 
      between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.<br/><br/>

      Travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes
       and villas in cities such as Pompeii and Baiae. While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and 
       more dominated by trade and migration, cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to mean 
       that travel has become easier and more accessible. Mankind has come a long way in transportation since 
       Christopher Columbus sailed to the new world from Spain in 1492, an expedition which took over 10 weeks to arrive
       at the final destination; to the 21st century where aircraft allow travel from Spain to the United States 
       overnight.<br/><br/>

      Travel in the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, however, it was important to the economy and to 
      society. The wholesale sector depended (for example) on merchants dealing with/through caravans or sea-voyagers, 
      nd-user retailing often demanded the services of many itinerant peddlers wandering from village to hamlet, 
      gyrovagues (Wandering Monks) and wandering friars brought theology and pastoral support to neglected areas, 
      traveling minstrels practiced the never-ending tour, and armies ranged far and wide in various crusades and in 
      sundry other wars. Pilgrimages were common in both the European and Islamic worlds and involved streams of 
      travelers both locally (Canterbury Tales-style) and internationally.<br/><br/>

      In the late 16th century it became fashionable for young European aristocrats and wealthy upper-class men to 
      travel to significant European cities as part of their education in the arts and literature. This was known as 
      the Grand Tour, it included cities such as London, Paris, Venice, Florence, and Rome. However, The French 
      revolution brought with it the end of the Grand Tour.<br/><br/>

      Travel by water often provided more comfort and speed than land-travel, at least until the advent of a network of
      railways in the 19th century. Travel for the purpose of tourism is reported to have started around this time 
      when people began to travel for fun as travel was no longer a hard and challenging task. This was capitalized on 
      by people like Thomas Cook selling tourism packages where trains and hotels were booked together. Airships and 
      airplanes took over much of the role of long-distance surface travel in the 20th century, notably after the 
      Second World War where there was a surplus of both aircraft and pilots. Indeed, air travel has become so 
      ubiquitous in the 21st century that one woman, Alexis Alford, visited all 196 countries before the age of 21.
